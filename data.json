The best part was being served by a robot üôåüèΩ first time ever I experienced that and I had no complaints.\n\nThe sushi is really well priced for a tourist, I ordered so many dishes and total came to under ¬£20 (GBP). I would definitely dine here again.\n\nOnly thing to note is that the green tea is not free! I wish the waitresses mentioned this before serving us this. Would be nice if they mentioned that as the bill will be increased by RM 7 if you take it. Hence the 4 star and not 5.",

We arrived at 8:20 and asked the server if there were any walk-in tables available. She said yes and seated us, but only serve us for a while then we were ignored the whole dinner despite pressing the ‚Äòcall‚Äô button several times. Not a single waitress came to our table, even though other customers only had to press the ‚Äòcall‚Äô button once to get service which pissed me off. I informed one of the waitresses about my missing order, but dont know if the waitress inform the kitchen or not or yall just purposely ignoring me????? Tapi meja depan order benda sama tapi dapat  dekat dorang dulu?? I dont know if yall straight up being bias with malay customers or yall priorities are only Chinese customers. Not tryna be racist be this is what happened to me tonight. Press the ‚Äúcall‚Äù button several time yall ignore, other Chinese customers press only once yall came",

As a sushi lover , I'm quite surprised that they had maguro sushi & salmon belly. I hope they will be able to serve Uni (sea urchin) Sushi. Here, they served both by conveyer belt & robot server . Affordable price , tasty & had Halal certified. Will repeat.",

Ordered few dishses, tempura rice set is very big portion, kids meal also very nice. Somemore got promotion if order 5 plates sushi only cost RM3.33 per plate regardless of plate color. Worth the value compared to other Japanese restaurants that also sell Sushi.\n\nEnvironment also good, clean. Can view the street if sit near the window. Just that finding a parking would be a challnging task as this is a buy street. Get ready to walk a distance to the bar but it's good as an exercise :)\n\nGot a discount voucher of RM10, definitely will be back again before the voucher expires in Feb 2024 :D.

We also ordered the bento sets, one is pork and another is teppanyaki grilled salmon. There are so many choices, and it can tempt you to visit again and again. Price wise it isn‚Äôt cheap nor expensive but the quality and size makes up for it. We are so full from the food and it comes up to ard 150 bucks. Thats why there is normally a queue going in. Mind you, the table is a bit small and fits only the sets, and if you order some ala carte dishes its best to take all the food off the tray to make space. Service is fast despite the crowd.

I am thoroughly surprised that for just RM3.68 per plate (as of Jan 2022), you are served good quality sushi.\n\nAll the ingredients tasted fresh especially the salmon, no rancid smell whatsoever. The set yakiniku also tasted good for the price. I do feel that the service was somewhat rushed but I do take note that I am already dining in slightly more than 1 hour before they close.\n\nAll in all, Sushi Jiro offers cheap, affordable, good quality, and somewhat authentic sushi that is unbeatable by its competitors.",

Too efficient until they kept coming to you to clear plates. Food wise, some are good some are so so. Salmon head shio is so so. Uni sushi is so so. Okay are the Ikura sushi, eel sushi mentaiko, salmon sushi mentaiko, ebi sushi mentaiko, ebi sushi spicy sauce, salmon sashimi, California hand roll. Value for money is the catch.

But upon seeing how 'dirty' the soup of the Mala Ramen, we went ahead and ordered the beef curry Don.\n\nHere's why we gave a horrendous rating.\n1) ramen by nature should've a clear broth. But your Mala Ramen is dirty AF. A lot of sediments. At best, it was a soup, not ramen. Just because u added some noodles and egg into the bowl, doesn't make it ramen.\n2) Your 'Don' was served on a plate. A simple Google would shows that Don is actually a bowl. On top of that, the curry itself doesn't have the Japanese curry taste, nor consistentcy. At that point, it was just a beef stew, not even curry.\n3) as stated, arrival time was around 7.40pm, ie just going into the dinner time. However, the sushi train was empty, with only a handful of sushi on it. A freaking disgrace.\n\nI am very critical about food. If you don't want people to F up nasi lemak or rendang, then Don't f up other people's cuisine too.",
